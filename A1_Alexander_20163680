```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Load required libraries and theme for plots

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
source("ThemePub.R")
```


Create measurements data frame using the dataGenerato.R script. This will create a data frame with 100 observations from 5 different species combined. Each species will contain a Limb_Width and Limb_Length value as well as 1 of 3 observers randomly assigned to it. The width and length values are taken from a normal distribution with mean 10 cm (sd = 3) and mean 30 cm (sd 10), respectively. The script will then create a csv file with headers "Organism" "Limb_Width" "Limb_Length" "Observer".

```{r}
source('dataGenerato.R')
```


Using the Limb_length and Limb_Width columns in the measurements table, the volumeEstimato.R script calculates Limb Volume by using the equation volume=((pi)*((Limb_Width/2)^2)*(Limb_Length). This script will then create a new measurement data frame with an added column for volume and then create a csv file that will overwrite the original measurement file created the previous dataGenerato.R script.  

```{r}
source('volumeEstimato.R')
```


Now that the measurement.csv has a volume column, we can load into session for future analysis.

```{r}
MeasureData = read.csv("~/Documents/BIOL_432/BIOL432_Assignment1/measurements.csv")
```

Sort the data based on species name, observer name, and limb volume.

```{r}
SortedMeasureData = MeasureData %>% arrange(Organism, Observer, volume)
```

Create a table showing the average volume for each species

```{r}
SpeciesvolMeans = SortedMeasureData %>% group_by(Organism) %>% summarise(Mean_Volume_cm3 = mean(volume))
SpeciesvolMeans
```
Table 1. Mean limb volume in cm^3 for each of the 5 species of interest. Volume was calculated according to the equation for cylinder volume (volume=((pi)*((Limb_Width/2)^2)*(Limb_Length)). 

Create a table showing the number of observations (i.e. rows) for each combination of species and observer.

```{r}
SpeciesObsCombos = MeasureData %>% group_by(Organism, Observer) %>% summarize(number_observations = n())
SpeciesObsCombos
```
Table 2. Count of observations for each combination of species and observer.

Create a single box plot to compare key features of the distributions of volumes for each species

```{r}
SpeciesVolBoxplot = ggplot(aes(x=Organism, y=volume), data = MeasureData) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("Volume cm^3") + xlab("Organism")
SpeciesVolBoxplot
```

Figure 1. Boxplot to compare distribution in limb volume amongst the 5 species/organisms of interest. Boxes represent interquartile range (IQR) while inner lines represent sample median. Whiskers represent variability outside of upper and lower quartile (1.5*IQR). Independent points represent outliers beyond the whisker range. Medians and IQR appear to relatively consistent among organisms.

Create a multi-panel plot showing frequency histograms showing the distribution of limb volume for each species.

```{r}
MPanelBoxplot = ggplot(MeasureData, aes(x = volume)) + labs(y = "Count of Volume Values (cm3)", x="Volume (cm3)") +
geom_histogram(bins = 10) +  facet_wrap(~Organism) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10000, by = 2000))
MPanelBoxplot
```

Figure 2. Multi-panel histogram displaying counts for each volume value. Volume counts appear to be relatively normally distributed with the presence of some outliers for some species.
